## Introduction

 Motazen is a mobile application that strives to help those who lack consistency by providing a virtual life coaching alternative. Hiring a life coach and attending multiple courses might not be a feasible option for many people yet creating goals and maintaining them is a vital part of self-development, so Motazen aims to fill that gap. It will help those who have a hard time building good habits by applying the Wheel of Life methodology and assessing each user’s needs based on a short survey, and create a clear, direct path as to how to reach their goals.
 Motazen will provide the following features:

1.	Assess the user’s current situation using self-assessment and visualize the result.

2.	Help the users organize their lives by allowing them to add goals, tasks, and habits.

3.	Encourage the user to achieve more by allowing them to view goals’ progress graphically.

4.	Engage the user and entice competition by creating private communities for friends to join goals and compare progress.

5.	Inspire the user to stick to their tasks by enabling them to create and join public communities with shared goals.

6.	Manage user’s thoughts and plans by providing a journal space with prompts related to user’s goals.

7.	Motivate the user by applying gamification methods in monitoring their progress.

8.	Help the user organize their daily routine and make progress by ranking their daily tasks.

the application is built using [Dart](https://dart.dev/) alongside the [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework. For local storage, Motazen relies on [Isar](https://isar.dev/), and as for Database and user authentication, Motazen uses [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
